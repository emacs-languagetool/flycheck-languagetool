### üìñ Spellchecking

LanguageTool‚Äôs spellchecking will be disabled if
[`flyspell-mode`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Spelling.html)
or [`jinx-mode`](https://github.com/minad/jinx) is active. Disable those
modes if you would prefer LanguageTool to check for spelling mistakes.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

You can find log messages from a local LanguageTool server in a hidden buffer called ` *LanguageTool server*`.
